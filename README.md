This is a lightweight project made to get better understanding in the basics of learning algorithms.
</br>
DESCRIPTION:</br>
The program accepts a phrase as an input, than creates random phrases and through the [genetic alorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) it creates new generations of better and better individuals (phrases) untill it recreates the given input. As I mentioned it's only an lightweight implementation of a genetic algorithm, I choose this text recreator functionality because it was easy to make a scoring system that guides the evolution, and to achieve a transparent development process.
